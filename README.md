# Personal Code Reference Library
This is a collection of code samples from various languages that I've collected. These are things I've needed to use from time-to-time.

As I find a useful command/script I try to store it here for future re-usability.

Quick hit commands are all stored within language-specific cheat sheets. Anything more substantial is broken out into individual scripts.
